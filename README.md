# [Project 1 : BigData on the spread of COVID-19 in the world : Project overview](https://github.com/MusaMasango/BigData-on-the-spread-of-COVID-19-in-the-world)
* Downloaded data from open sources,
* Performed preliminary data cleaning
* Performe correlation and EDA analysis.
* Built models using 2 different frameworks (linear regression and time series).
* Built a forecast and analyzed the accuracy and adequacy of the obtained models.
* Visualized the dynamics of COVID-19 infection spread on interactive maps

# [Project 2 : loan-prediction-machine-learning-project : Project overview](https://github.com/MusaMasango/loan-prediction-machine-learning-project)

In finance, a loan is the lending of money by one or more individuals, organizations, or other entities to other individuals, organizations etc. The recipient (i.e., the borrower) incurs a debt and is usually liable to pay interest on that debt until it is repaid as well as to repay the principal amount borrowed. (wikipedia). The major aim of this project is to predict which of the customers will have their loan approved. This is important especially for the banks as they have to be sure that a particular customer meets the requirements for loan approval. 
 
I was able to model the loan_status of the customers with a 83% accuracy after minimal tuning. This result however can be further improved with better data as well as other useful information.
